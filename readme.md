# MultiBound - Starbound Profile Launcher
MultiBound allows you to set up separate profiles/"instances" with different saves, mod loadouts, etc.; perfect for separating your Frackin' Universe and non-FU saves, or what have you.

( For compilation on *nix systems, see [#1](https://github.com/zetaPRIME/MultiBound/issues/1) )
